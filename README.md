# ML-Attack-on-MLWE

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning-based cryptanalysis framework targeting Module-LWE and Ring-LWE schemes. The approach combines lattice reduction (via Flatter and BKZ 2.0) with robust regression techniques to recover secrets from noisy, modular samples under realistic cryptographic parameters.

The attack supports multiple secret distributions (binary, ternary, CBD), various lattice embeddings, and is optimized for efficient preprocessing and minimal training data.

ðŸ“„ This code accompanies the MSc thesis *"AI-based attacks on Module-LWE: Assessing the security of module-lattice-based schemes"* (Radboud University, 2025).
